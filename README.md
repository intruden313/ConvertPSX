This is a personal script that I am working on to learn more about Python Scripting and Execution.
I am utilizing PSXPackager thanks to https://github.com/RupertAvery/PSXPackager

- For Personal Use Only
- Purely as a learning experience

Instructions:
1. The script will ask you to enter a path to your PSX Library. 
2. It will then scan that directory + sub directories looking for .chd files
3. The next step will be to take these new .cue/bin files and pipe them into PSXPackager merging multi-disc games into a .pbp file
Accompanied by a .m3u file.
